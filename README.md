Just in case the .sh file I uploaded isn't visible to you, I have attached the loop inside of this link. [state.sh](./state.sh)

```
bash state.sh
```
This tells the computer to follow the command that is within a shapefile called state.sh. The command within the shapefile is a loop (see below) isolates the name and first line of text for each of the data locations around the country. It then deposits the results in a separate textfile called state_output.txt.
